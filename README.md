# Hydration Hero  

This is a small game that my teammates and I developed using Python and Pygame during our first year as part of our participation in an intra-college hackathon.

## About the Game  

**Hydration Hero** is a fun and creative game with two main goals:  
1. **Entertainment and Reaction Building**  
2. **Educating Players on Healthy Habits**  
   - Encouraging regular water intake.  
   - Avoiding junk food.  

The game merges the themes of **EdTech** and **HealthTech**, presenting a unique idea we passionately implemented using **Python** and the **Pygame library**.

## Our Plan of Deliverance  

One critical question we addressed during development was:  

> **How does this game effectively solve the problem?**  

If our goal is to educate players about healthy habits, how does the game achieve this? Or does it even work?  

### The Answer  

Our game serves as an **efficient catalyst** in promoting healthy habits—please note, *catalyst*.  
It uses **"Repetitive Subtle Reminders"**, prompting players with text messages at various stages of the game.

### Why Does This Work?  

Consider this scenario:  
If someone motivates you to exercise one day with a passionate speech, you might do it that day, or even the next. But after 3–4 days, there's a high chance you'll quit.  

What if there was another method that had a **higher retention rate**?  

### How Our Game Helps  

1. **Repetitive Subtle Reminders**:  
   - Players receive consistent but subtle messages during gameplay.  
   - These create a subconscious response, gradually encouraging players to adopt the habits.  

2. **Motivation Through Fun**:  
   - The game format itself eliminates the need for external motivation.  
   - Who doesn’t enjoy playing a simple, endless-themed game?

## Conclusion  

Hydration Hero works on the principle of **"slow and steady"**, which is far more effective for habit-building than making big, unsustainable changes from the start.  

We hope you enjoy playing our game as much as we enjoyed creating it! 🎮✨
